# Online-Laundry-Service

## About the Project
The Online Laundry Service is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing laundry services for students. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to submit their laundry, track the status of their laundry, and update their profiles. Admins can manage the laundry status and view all laundry submissions.

### ðŸ’¡Motivation
- Firstly, there were long lines where people had to stand to give their clothes for laundry servicing, this was altogether a very time-consuming process.
- Secondly, for writing the list of clothes the person uses a lot of paper which results in plenty of wastage of paper.
- The project aims to address problems with the current laundry system. Instead of using paper slips, the proposed solution involves creating a website for students at IIT Jodhpur and the laundry service. Students will input their laundry details on the website, and the laundry guy will have access to admin page to manage the laundry. This online system will save time and reduce the risk of losing paper slips.
